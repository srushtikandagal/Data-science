# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Keras-and-Recurrent-Neural-Network
Stock Price Prediction case study using Keras

🌟 Overview
This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict Google stock prices. It's a perfect starting point for exploring time-series forecasting using deep learning.

By training on historical stock price data, the model predicts future prices and provides a visualization comparing real vs. predicted prices, helping you gain insights into model performance and potential real-world applications.

🧩 Features
✔️ Historical Data Analysis: Preprocesses and scales time-series data for model input.
✔️ Deep Learning Architecture: Implements a 4-layer LSTM-based RNN.
✔️ Time-Series Forecasting: Accurate predictions based on historical trends.
✔️ Visualization: Generates insightful plots comparing real vs. predicted prices.
✔️ Easy Customization: Adaptable to other datasets and forecasting problems.

📊 Visualization
The project outputs a line graph comparing the real stock prices and the model's predictions:

🔴 Real Stock Prices: Ground truth values from the test dataset.
🔵 Predicted Stock Prices: Generated by the trained RNN model.


🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Libraries:
NumPy: Numerical computations
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
Matplotlib: Visualization
Keras (TensorFlow backend): Building and training the deep learning model
Scikit-learn: Data normalization (MinMaxScaler)


✨ How It Works
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Loads the training data and scales it between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler.
Creates input-output pairs for the RNN with a time window of 60 days.
Step 2: Building the Model
Initializes a Sequential model with 4 LSTM layers and Dropout for regularization.
Compiles the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
Step 3: Training the Model
Trains the model on the training set for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32.
Step 4: Making Predictions
Preprocesses the test data and predicts stock prices for the test set.
Inverse transforms the predictions to match the original scale.
Step 5: Visualizing Results
Plots the real vs. predicted stock prices using Matplotlib.



🎯 Results and Insights
This RNN-based model demonstrates the ability of LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data. While it’s not suitable for financial trading due to inherent volatility, it provides a strong foundation for understanding time-series forecasting.

🛠️ Customization
Extend Dataset: Replace Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv and Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv with your own datasets for other stocks or time-series problems.
Adjust Hyperparameters: Modify rnn.py to experiment with:
Number of LSTM layers and units.
Dropout rates for regularization.
Batch size and number of epochs.
Add Features: Enhance the model by incorporating:
Moving averages or additional technical indicators.
External features like news sentiment analysis.
