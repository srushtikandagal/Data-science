Stock Price Prediction Using Keras and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Overview

This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model provides a robust approach to time-series forecasting by capturing temporal dependencies in stock market trends. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance visualization.

Key Features

Historical Data Analysis: Preprocesses and scales stock price data for effective input into the model.

Deep Learning Architecture: Implements a multi-layered LSTM-based RNN.

Time-Series Forecasting: Accurately predicts future stock prices based on historical trends.

Visualization: Generates insightful plots comparing real vs. predicted stock prices.

Outlier Handling: Detects and removes outliers using box plots and IQR analysis.

Customizable Framework: Adaptable for other datasets and forecasting problems.

Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing

Import historical stock price data from Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv.

Perform feature scaling using MinMaxScaler to normalize values between 0 and 1.

Create time-series data sequences for training with a sliding window approach.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generate histograms to understand the data distribution and identify outliers.

Use box plots to visualize and handle outliers using the IQR method.

3. Model Building

Build an RNN model with the following architecture:

LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies.

Dropout layers for regularization and overfitting prevention.

Dense layers for output predictions.

Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function.

4. Model Training

Train the model on the prepared dataset for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32.

Evaluate model performance on the test set (Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv).

5. Performance Evaluation

Visualize real vs. predicted stock prices using Matplotlib.

Assess prediction accuracy with metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
